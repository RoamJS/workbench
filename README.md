## Migration Guide

_This extension was first started by [TfTHacker](https://twitter.com/tfthacker) as Roam42 and passed over to RoamJS on 04/20/2021. We are deeply appreciative of all of TftHacker's hard work and generosity._

If you have never used `Roam42` while it was a RoamJS extension, you can safely ignore this.

For Roam42 users, use the [migration guide](https://github.com/RoamJs/workbench/blob/main/docs/migration-guide.md) to migrate to the Roam Depot version.
