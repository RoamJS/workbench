Roam42 is built on the open-source work of other greater coders.
We are so thankful to them for their contributions to the community
and also for sharing their work. I want to acknowledge them here:

* [github.com/mgsloan/roam-navigator](https://github.com/mgsloan/roam-navigator) - Thanks [Michael Sloan](https://mgsloan.com) (Twitter: [@treetopian](https://twitter.com/treetopian))
* [github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit](https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit) - Live preview came from this code base. it has been heavily modified, but the core is still from the toolkit. What an amazing project that pioneered extending Roam
