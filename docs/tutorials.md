When the WorkBench extension loads, it will place a WorkBench menu icon on the Roam top bar next to the sidebar open icon.

The menu will show menu items toggling on the core feature of other features. It includes three of its own: tutorials, quick reference, and graph database stats.

## Tutorials

Can be invoked from the command palette or by hitting `OPT+Shift+q`, will open a drawer on the left showing a bunch of resources collaborated from the Roam community. You can watch them from directly within Roam, be sure to check some out!

## Quick Reference

Can be invoked from the command palette or by hitting `CTRL+Shift-q`, will open a help menu similar to the native Roam one on the left hand side. In addition, it will include quick references to shortcuts and other actions key to extensions like WorkBench.

## Graph Database Stats

Can be invoked from the command palette or by hitting `OPT+Shift+b`, will open a drawer on the right hand size with a bunch of various statistics about your Roam graph. This helps you track how your graph grows over time by presenting detailed statistics about your database, including total pages, text blocks, code blocks, and interconnections!

# Hotkeys

It's possible to assign a unique hotkey to individual commands, should you prefer to do so. To accomplish this, navigate to either `Settings` > `Hotkeys` or the WorkBench Extension Settings.
